# Detecting Rocks in Challenging Mining Environments using Convolutional Neural Networks and Ellipses as an alternative to Bounding Boxes

## Abstract

The automation of heavy-duty machinery and vehicles used in underground mines is a growing tendency which requires addressing several challenges, such as the robust detection of rocks in the production areas of mines. For instance, human assistance must be requested when using autonomous LHD (Load-Haul-Dump) loaders in case rocks are too big to be loaded into the bucket. Also, in the case of autonomous rock breaking hammers, oversized rocks need to be identified and located, to then be broken in smaller sections. In this work, a novel approach called Rocky-CenterNet is proposed for detecting rocks. Unlike other object detectors, Rocky-CenterNet uses ellipses to enclose a rock’s bounds, enabling a better description of the shape of the rocks than the classical approach based on bounding boxes. The performance of Rocky-CenterNet is compared with the one of CenterNet and Mask R-CNN, which use bounding boxes and segmentation masks, respectively. The comparisons were performed on two datasets: the Hammer-Rocks dataset (introduced in this work) and the Scaled Front View dataset. The Hammer-Rocks dataset was captured in an underground ore pass, while a rock-breaking hammer was operating. This dataset includes challenging conditions such as the presence of dust in the air and occluded rocks. The metrics considered are related to the quality of the detections and the processing times involved. From the results, it is shown that ellipses provide a better approximation of the rocks shapes’ than bounding boxes. Moreover, when rocks are annotated using ellipses, Rocky-CenterNet offers the best performance while requiring shorter processing times than Mask-RCNN (4x faster). Thus, using ellipses to describe rocks is a reliable alternative.

## Highlights:
- A detector named Rocky-CenterNet is proposed that detects rocks as ellipses
- Rocky-CenterNet runs 4x faster than Mask R-CNN
- Rocky-CenterNet is a suitable alternative for mining applications

## Main results

Evaluation for Rocky-CenterNet was done with the flip_text flag on (meaning both the original image and horizontally flipped images outputs are averaged and used), while Rocky-CenterNet's metrics were obtained conventionally, as no benefit was obtained using test augmentation in inference.

## Installation

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](readme/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

## Use Rocky-CenterNet

You can demo rock detection on images.

First, download the models (By default, [rockdet_coco_dla_2x](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15EkBUSIB_mDNhkXTHLzLJdrM_2azG1Am/view?usp=sharing) for detection with ellipses, or [ctdet_coco_dla_2x](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2OrQWuilNepO2LCcMH694Sc5-VhtyqO/view?usp=sharing) for detection with bounding boxes, from the [Model zoo](readme/MODEL_ZOO.md) and put them in `Rocky-CenterNet_ROOT/models/`.

For object detection on images, run:

~~~
python demo.py rockdet --demo /path/to/image/or/folder/or/video --load_model ../models/rockdet_rock_coco_dla_2x.pth
python demo.py ctdet --demo /path/to/image/or/folder/or/video --load_model ../models/ctdet_rock_coco_dla_2x.pth
~~~
We provide example images in images (from the [Scaled Front Dataset and Hammer Rocks Dataset](http://datos.uchile.cl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34691/FK2/1GQBHK)). If set up correctly, the output should look like

<p align="center"> <img src='readme/det_rcn_periodic_8_bag_frame0003.png' align="center" height="230px"> <img src='readme/det_rcn_vlcsnap-2018-04-02-10h02m52s32.png' align="center" height="230px"> </p>

To use this Rocky-CenterNet in your own project, you can

~~~
import sys
ROCKYCENTERNET_PATH = /path/to/Rocky-CenterNet/src/lib/
sys.path.insert(0, ROCKYCENTERNET_PATH)

from detectors.detector_factory import detector_factory
from opts import opts

MODEL_PATH = /path/to/model
TASK = 'rockdet' # or 'ctdet' for detection with bounding-boxes
opt = opts().init('{} --load_model {}'.format(TASK, MODEL_PATH).split(' '))
detector = detector_factory[opt.task](opt)

img = image/or/path/to/your/image/
ret = detector.run(img)['results']
~~~
`ret` will be a python dict: `{category_id : [[xc, yc, a, b, ang, score], ...], }` (rockdet task) or `{category_id : [[x1, y1, x2, y2, score], ...], }` (ctdet task)
